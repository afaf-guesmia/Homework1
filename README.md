Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python
Description:
The program reads from the CSV data file and modifies each row in the file to the right (capitalize last/first name, replace non-existing middle names to X, modify the ID to two letters and 4 digits, and also phone numbers should be in the form of 123-456-7890.)
It creates an object of the class and saves it to a dict and then creates a pickle file. 
How to run: 
The program can run from the command line by entering python axg190061.HW1.py /data/data.csv
In my opinion, python text processing is great for practice and getting familiar with the different libraries, however, it can be challenging for a beginner as it is implemented differently than OOP languages. It is also simple to work with files using python to edit or write in a different types of files. 
I learned that indexing is crucial when it comes to python, simple double indexing can cause a problem in how the code should behave mostly when there is multiple for loops or if-else statement. I took the chance to get more familiar with lists and dict for this assignment.
